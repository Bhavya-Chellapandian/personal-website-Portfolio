              I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience as a Full Stack Developer Intern, skilled in
              building mini full-stack applications and exploring backend scripting. As a creative final-year B.Tech IT
              student, I have developed a solid foundation in front-end development and am eager to leverage my web
              development and UI/UX skills in dynamic environments.

              experiences through thoughtful design and efficient code.
